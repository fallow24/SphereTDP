# Spherical SLAM 

This repository summarizes the results of the research conducted during the "Team Design Project" course within the "Satellite Technology" Masters Program at the Julius-Maximilians University in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany in the Winter Semester 2020/21.
The goal of this project was to design, implement and test and Spherical Robotic system that can be used for SLAM purposes.
In particular this project is an extension of [L.U.N.A.](https://github.com/fallow24/L.U.N.A).

There are three major parts to this work: 
- A smooth pose estimation filter using inertial measurement units for spherical robots
- A dataset simulation program for evaluation of post processing procedures
- A post processing procedure that exploits the fact that many measured environments contain planes.

All in all we hope to acomplish and convincingly show that SLAM using spherical robots can be of high quality.
